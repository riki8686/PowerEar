These files are attached to support the submission of the paper entitled "PowerEar: An Audio Eavesdropping Attack on Mobile Devices through USB Power Side Channel".

The examples for the audio reconstruction performed with PowerEar framework are organized as follows.
For a device X, the folder "./devices/X/" contains the original and reconstructed audio from device X. 
For a language Y, the folder "./languages/Y/" contains the original and reconstructed audio in language Y.
Each folder also contains the spectrograms for original audio, raw power trace (powertrace_raw), denoised power trace (powertrace_denoise), and reconstructed audio.
